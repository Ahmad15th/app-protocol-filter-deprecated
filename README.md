# ClearOS Protocol Filter
The ClearOS Protocol Filter powered by l7-filter has been deprecated.  Fear not... a new Protocol Filter solution powered by [Netify and open source DPI](https://www.netify.ai/resources/developer/netifyd) is now available in ClearOS 7!  You can find more information about the ClearOS app here: https://www.egloo.ca/products/clearos/protocol-filter

Some of the protocols that can be blocked include:
- Bittorrent
- Steam
- VNC
- Dropbox
- Skype
- OpenVPN

Note: some of the old protocols detected in l7-filter are now handled in a different way and implemented using the [Netify Application Filter](https://www.egloo.ca/products/clearos/application-filter).  The following apps and web sites can be blocked:
- Facebook
- Instagram
- Snapchat
- Netflix
